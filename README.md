# Dialler_Interface
This is a Interface for a dialler project 

This is only an Interface for one of my projects that I build.
The purpose of this project is to allow us to be familiar with the
java GUI framework.

The code has some errors during compilation, but it will run. 
You might encounter an error when closing the app, which I am currently trying to fix.

The text file are a list of names for the drop down menu, thier are three names that corresponds to icons and other three
for just quick dial. You can modify the text file to add names that you want.
